## How to: 

use the command: 
    npx create-react-app template-app --template typescript

in an empty project to setup the original file sets 



## Converting a project from JS to TS: 
We can add the types using the below commands: 
    yarn add typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node 

Change the app.jsx to app.tsx

Once you use yarn start, then the script will automatically configure the tsconfig 

Once this has run we will encounter an error and this can be fixed by doing as the error recommends and installing the package below: 

yarn add @types/react-router-dom

Once the above is done and we run the app again with yarn start, then it will succeed

Make sure npm is installed:

Run the following command to install angular.cli globally: 
    npm install -g @angular/cli 

Once this has successfully run, you can use the ng command from anywhere. Ng standing for angular 

The following command will create a new instance, first navigate to the folder you wish to create angular in. Then run the following command:

ng new <project-name> --prefix pm

Choose whether you want routing (we'll be writing routing later on) and what stylesheet you'll use. For now we'll say no to routing and choose CSS. You can also choose to setup autocomplete, I said no, but you can change this via the following command <ng completion>

Once that command has run then the whole file directory will be auto generated for you to begin working.

From there you can navigate into the application and type 
    NPM start 
to start the application.
